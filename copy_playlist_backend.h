/**
 * \struct copy_playlist_backend
 * \brief cross platform framework that allow to copy songs of a playlist (from several format) into a folder or a mass storage device
 *  This framework is a full Qt implementation. Currently only m3u are supported. This framework is design for a unidirectional synchronization_type
 * Typically you would use it to sync the songs and playlist of your mp3 player or smartphone from you computer once you have connected it
 * with usb.
